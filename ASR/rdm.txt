Requirements : google account

I created a project where I need to add people manually using their @, but uou can also create your own using the following links.

Launch the asr.py and if everything is setup correctly, a message with "Microphone Listening..." should appear. 
The program will then show you the text it hears as soon as it detects the end of an utterance. It doesn't work well with multiple
speakers / loud environments : the returned sentence will be a mix of different sentences.

If the program is stuck at "Microphone Listening...", check the microphone settings. It may also be caused by headphones being plugged in
for some reason.
